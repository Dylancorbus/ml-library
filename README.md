# Simple ML-Library
Simple machine learning library with multi language support. This is an ongoing project
I will be adding to as I progress through the Coursera Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng.


## Features:

* Small matrix library for performing common operations like transposing, matrix multiplication(scalar and matrix matrix multiplication)
* Regression algorithm for linear datasets
